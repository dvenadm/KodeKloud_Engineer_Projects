## About the platform

[KodeKloud Engineer](https://kodekloud-engineer.com/#!/project_brief) is a platform which provides hands-on training on Cloud and DevOps technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Linux and others.

It puts you on the shoes of a newly-hired employee at a fictional company called **xFusion Corp**, assigned to a project in which you will have to complete tasks to earn points and practice the skills required for the job.

Initially, you are hired as a SysAdmin but, through accumulating points by completing tasks, you can move on to two other roles: DevOps Engineer and DevOps Architect, with increasingly complex assignments. These tasks are also divided in 3 difficulty categories: easy, medium and hard.

The company assigns you to the **Nautilus Marine** project, with the network infrastructure detailed [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/58e22de2-c446-4b49-ae0f-db79a3318e97/view?page=0_0#). Naturally, the employee will have to consult both the infrastructure diagram and more documentation in order to complete the tasls, especially the more complex they get, just as a real job.
